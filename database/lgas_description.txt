Information about the lgas16.csv and lga data set.
Based on Australian Bureau of Statistics data.

This data set records the Local Government Areas (LGAs) across Australia for the 2016 calendar year, as used in the 2016 Australian Census.

Local Government Area (LGAs) are designated by a unique code. Note that these codes do not necessarily correspond to suburbs or council areas. Each LGA is constrained within a single State or Territory. Simple maps of each LGA are found can be found on the COSC2803 Canvas, listed by LGA code and/or name.

This data file has been compiled from the data pack  "1270.0.55.003 - Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS): Volume 3 - Non ABS Structures", as available on the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) website:

1270.0.55.003 - Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS): Volume 3 - Non ABS Structures - Product Information (2016)
The Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGAs) are an ABS approximation of officially gazetted Local Government Areas as defined by each State and Territory Local Government Department. The 2016 ASGS edition of Local Government Areas takes into account the August 2016 PSMA Australia edition of the Administrative Boundaries. This includes the nineteen new, New South Wales councils, announced on the 12 May 2016 at https://www.strongercouncils.nsw.gov.au/.

Local Government Areas cover incorporated areas of Australia only. Incorporated areas are legally designated parts of a State or Territory over which incorporated local governing bodies have responsibility. The major areas of Australia not administered by incorporated bodies are the northern parts of South Australia, and all of the Australian Capital Territory and the Other Territories. These regions are identified as ‘Unincorporated’ in the ASGS Local Government Areas structure.

1270.0.55.003 - Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS): Volume 3 - Non ABS Structures - Product Information (2021)

This product releases updates to the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Non-ABS Structure regions that have changed since 2019. Changes have occurred in the Local Government Areas (LGAs) and State Electoral Divisions (SEDs) since the original release of the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Non ABS Structure regions. This is the final planned release of Non ABS Structures for the second edition of the ASGS (ASGS 2016). The next release of Non ABS Structures will be in 2021.

This update to the Local Government Areas (LGAs) and State Electoral Divisions (SEDs) contains allocation files showing the relationship between 2016 Mesh Blocks or Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1s) and the new region definitions. This update also includes updated codes and labels for regions that have changed since the last edition. This information allows users to allocate 2016 Census and other data to the new region definitions. Revised ABS versions of the digital boundaries are also included for these new region definitions.

To enable TableBuilder users to access 2016 Census data using the latest LGA and SED boundaries, Census TableBuilder Recode files are also available in the Downloads tab of this publication. For more information on how to use recodes, see the Custom Data section of the TableBuilder User Guide. System restrictions have been implemented within Census TableBuilder which prevent the cross-tabulation of certain data items within certain 2016 Census Pro datasets. In some instances these restrictions may impact on the usability of geographical recodes. For further information see Using TableBuilder for Census Data.
